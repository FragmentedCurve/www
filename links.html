<li><a href="http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/advice.html">Advice for amateur mathematicians on writing and publishing papers</a>
&#x2014; From the source: There's no reason why amateurs can't make
worthwhile research contributions in mathematics. It has happened
many times in the past, and I know of several cases today. I don't
have time to offer a lot of personal advice and guidance, but I
figured I'd post some general advice here. I've aimed it at people
who think they've already solved famous problems, since those are
the sort that typically write, but it should be equally useful for
people with more modest aspirations. I focus on the mechanics of how
to do literature searches, write papers, and publish them, because I
have less to say about the deeper issue of how to do research. None
of this advice is specific to amateurs, but professionals already
learn all these things from their advisors.</li>
