I met a man today. I've seen 'em before. They pop up once in a
while. You see them scattered among the people. Waiting in shopping
lines, walking out of public restrooms, using a vending machine.

His face was covered with wrinkles. They weren't the soft, clean,
bendy kind. They felt hard. Like the grand canyon, they were here to
stay. He wore them like battle scars. They meant something. Stories
were told through those wrinkles. But you could never quite make out
what they were saying. You'd strain your ear, but only hear a
mumble. A whispering scream. They didn't speak your language.

I saw him on the Dunkin' Donuts line. Waiting to order a coffee. The
brown leather of his boots were growing little hairs from the constant
use. He looked everyone in the eye. And smiled, but people shuffled
the other way. Nobody quite knew what to say. Above his denim jeans
was a gray sweatshirt that felt like it was saying, “I use to have a
color”. Two young girls were in front of him, chatting away as their
silky hair was held back by ears and ponytails. About school,
cellphones, boys. They stood there with one knee bent and a hand on
the hip, wearing brightly colored fuzzy boots. The man would smile and
look at the gaudy footwear. "Those are some nice boots" he opened. "I
need a new pair. Maybe I should get those." he said trying to get a
laugh or smile. The talking stopped. You could hear the silent growl
from one of the girls, as her smile left her face and her lip
raised. They awkwardly stood there, not sure where to look. He took no
offense and talked a little more. Telling a few more lighthearted
jokes. The girls didn't respond much. Only "yeah" and "mhmm" once in a
while.

One day, he stood outside Dunkin' Donuts. With a bag of two doughnuts,
I walked out the door heading straight for my bike. The grease slowly
soaking into the white paper bag. He asked me for a lighter, reaching
out his hand. He looked deep into my eyes. He reached right in, and
put a small piece of himself inside. "I don't smoke", I said. We stood
there silently for about 10 seconds, which felt like a decade. Our
eyes were communicating. He didn't want a lighter. His hand remained
fixed in space waiting for a lighter to come. "I'm sorry" I say,
breaking this silent connection.

A few weeks went by. I went to Dunkin' Donuts to pick up a bacon, egg
and cheese in between classes. While waiting in the line, I look down
at the stack of local papers. Looking for something to entertain as I
wait for the mix of usuals and new comers to finish ordering. A John
Doe washed up. Found by a local fisherman. The paper printed a picture
found in his wallet. Standing next to a women with a child between his
arms. His skin felt soft and smooth. Smiling with the kind of purity a
child has laying on the grass with his friends, after a long day of
adventures. Finding all the possible pictures in the clouds.

Later that week, I went to the burial ground where the state rests the
ashes of the unclaimed. I set a Bic lighter down, not knowing if he's
there or not. "I'm sorry", I said. "Here's a lighter." My eyes gazed
down at the mass grave, looking nowhere.

There's a blue Bic in my pocket now. The Zippos don't last.
