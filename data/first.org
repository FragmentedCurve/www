* What am I doing with this site?

For too long, I couldn't decide what I wanted to do with this
site. Part of me wanted to put up a blog, while another part wanted
something more like an index of PDF articles. I have old content I'd
like to repost on web and a blog didn't seem like the right format for
such a thing.

Additionally, did I want the content to display a professional
skill-set or be a personal expression? If it's the former, I'd have to
avoid posting any artwork I produce and narrow down the topics to
mathematics and programming. (I still prefer the term "programming" to
"software engineering".) 

In the end, I decided this will be a dumping ground for everything
me. So, you'll see content from the past, present, and future. The
topics will range from illustrations to programming to cooking to $X \mid
X \in U$ where $U$ is the set of all teh tings.

Welcome aboard.
