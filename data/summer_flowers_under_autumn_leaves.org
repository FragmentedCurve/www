I saw only the leaf as it swam through the soft air to where the
summer flowers lived.  Once it sank, it could never swim back. My
palms touching the soft fabric of my coat pockets, sleeping, only
moving to feel. Move as your lover does while she's sleeping on fresh
sheets. Pushing herself against the fabric just to sense the presence
of the sheets, embedding herself within them. The fresh sheets. Unlike
the leaf though, she'll never sink into the sheets. She'll always swim
back. There's no place to live within the sheets. But a leaf always
has a place atop the summer flowers.
