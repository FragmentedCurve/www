* Links

Because search engines are broken, here's a collection of links that I
find interesting and/or useful.


** Individual Person Sites

- [[http://wandel.ca/][Markus Wandel]] --- He's an engineer with other hobbies. The website
  hasn't been updated since 2009, but it's still worth looking at. I
  found this guy's site over 10 years ago. The first page I read was
  about his [[http://wandel.ca/homepage/pbx.html][homemade PBX]] (which
  I recommend reading).
- [[https://wozniak.ca/][Geoff Wozniak]] --- A small but interesting programmer's blog.
- [[https://nullprogram.com/][null program: Chris Wellons]] --- This blog belongs to a programmer
  and is all about programming. His posts are technical and
  interesting with C being a favorite topic of his.
- [[http://www.azillionmonkeys.com][Paul Hsieh]] --- This is an older site that's no longer updated but
  still worth looking at; especially if you're interested in assembly
  programming.
- [[https://www.vttoth.com/CMS/][Viktor T. Toth]] --- A career programmer who's life passion is physics.
- [[https://www.devdungeon.com/][DevDungeon]] --- A blog and more by John Daniel Leon. The primary
  topics here are related programming, cybersecurity, software
  freedom, and electronics.
- [[https://derivativedribble.wordpress.com/][Charles Davi]] --- He's a mathematician that worked in financial
  services for eight years, most recently at BlackRock, spending a
  significant portion of his free time conducting research in
  information theory. His posts are often controversial, but his work
  might be worth taking a look at.
- [[http://findsomethingandburnit.com/][Jim Vicious]] --- An eccentric mad scientist type character with too
  many projects in the works including an "armored and weaponized
  zombie apocalypse pyrate beast" truck.
- [[https://augusterdwilliamsjr.com/][Auguster D Williams Jr]] --- Mixed Media Artist, US Navy Veteran,
  chess enthusiast and friend.
  
** Cooking & Food

- [[https://based.cooking/][Based Cooking]] --- A clean simple recipe directory with no ads created
  by [[https://lukesmith.xyz/][Luke Smith]].
- [[https://web.archive.org/web/20020205023717/http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/1721/martha4.html][Martha Stewart's Cobbler Dough]] --- Originally found on geocities, I've
  used this recipe many times.
- [[http://www.manjulaskitchen.com/][Manjula's Kitchen]] --- Straight from the source: "Manjula is here to
  teach you simple and practical recipes that carry out the
  authenticity of Indian vegetarian cooking."

** Physics

- [[https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html][How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist]]
- [[https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/26/from-the-fledgling-physicist-archives-if-susan-can-learn-physics-so-can-you][If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You]]
- [[https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics][So You Want to Learn Physics]]
- [[http://www.coultersmithing.com/forums/index.php][Coulter Smithing: Science/Engineering/Technical forums]] --- These
  forums are meant to foster a community, and build up useful
  information for all to read and learn from. The intent is to stick
  primarily to practical, hands-on, experiential knowledge in most of
  the forums here, in other words, things that teach someone else what
  you know.

** Mathematics

- [[http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/advice.html][Advice for amateur mathematicians on writing and publishing papers]]
  --- From the source: There's no reason why amateurs can't make
  worthwhile research contributions in mathematics. It has happened
  many times in the past, and I know of several cases today. I don't
  have time to offer a lot of personal advice and guidance, but I
  figured I'd post some general advice here. I've aimed it at people
  who think they've already solved famous problems, since those are
  the sort that typically write, but it should be equally useful for
  people with more modest aspirations. I focus on the mechanics of how
  to do literature searches, write papers, and publish them, because I
  have less to say about the deeper issue of how to do research. None
  of this advice is specific to amateurs, but professionals already
  learn all these things from their advisors.
- [[http://www.openproblemgarden.org/][Open Problem Garden]] --- A collection of open (unsolved) problems in
  mathematics.
- [[https://www.math.purdue.edu/pow/][Purdue's Problem of the Week]] --- Weekly math problems to solve.

** Computer Security / Hacking

- [[https://overthewire.org/][Over The Wire]] --- This site has been around forever. It has a good
  collection of wargames.
- [[https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html][Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)]] --- CWEâ„¢ is a community-developed
  list of software and hardware weakness types. It serves as a common
  language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline
  for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.
- [[https://www.wechall.net/][We Chall]] --- For the people not familiar with challenge sites, a
  challenge site is mainly a site focused on offering
  computer-related problems. Users can register at such a site and
  start solving challenges. There exist lots of different challenge
  types. The most common ones are the following: Cryptographic,
  Crackit, Steganography, Programming, Logic and Math/Science. The
  difficulty of these challenges vary as well.
  
** Utilities

- [[http://surusu.com/][SuRuSu]] --- A flash card replacement similar to Anki.
- [[https://www.upcdatabase.com/][UPC Database]] --- A crowd sourced database of UPC (and more) barcodes.

** World Affairs

 - [[http://cryptome.org/][Cryptome]] --- Before WikiLeaks there was cryptome, but no one knew.
