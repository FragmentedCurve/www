;; Define your articles and their display-order on the website in *articles* below.
;; Display Order is 'lifo', i.e. the top entry in this list gets displayed as the topmost entry.
;; 
;; An Example Of A Minimal Definition:
;; (list :id "4" :date "2015-05-04" :title "The article title" :author "Me" :tiny "Short description for home page")
;;
;; A Note On Keywords:
;; :author  can be omitted.   If so, it's value gets replaced by the value of :webmaster.
;; :tiny    can be omitted.   If so, the article's full text gets displayed on the all-articles view. (most people don't want this.)

(defvar *articles*
  (list
   ;; README
   (list :id "README"    :date "23 November 2017"  :tag "cl-yag README"
	 :title "README" :author "lambda"     :short "cl-yag's README got reworked." :tiny "Read cl-yag's README")
