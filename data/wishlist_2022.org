#+TITLE: Wish List: 2022

I'm taking this opportunity to test a new feature. More than once I've
had the need to create public check lists. Such as when friends and
family want to surprise me with a gift and an Amazon wishlist won't
suffice. It would be handy to have a list that would easily allow them
to check off when an item is bought, independent of which site it's
bought from.

Items on the list with an ❎ aren't bought yet. If you buy an item,
click the ❎ and fill in the password. It'll change to a ✅
afterwards.
